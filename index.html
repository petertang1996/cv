      <p>I am someone with no real identity.  I was born into a world that tried to give me all kinds of labels,
      but <strong>I am no longer interested in any of them.</strong></p>
      <p>So Peter Tang was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1978.  During his younger years, he played exclusively with
      his older brother Andy.  Peter noticed his brother leaving for school, a place named
      <a href="https://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/YardvilleHeights.cfm" target="_blank">Yardville Heights</a>.  He was curious what it was all about
      and wanted to go too.  Eventually he got his turn, and the game began.  There was the social game of fitting in,
      making friends, and having someone to play with.  As he grew older, girls became more and more interesting.  It
      was this social training that created Peter's early identity.  Other things that contributed to his identity were
      his family, and definitely religion.</p>
